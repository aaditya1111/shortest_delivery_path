# shortest_delivery_path

<h3>Assumptions :-</h3>

1. There would be 6 possible pathways for Aman to deliver foods from R1 & R2 restaurants to C1 & C2 customers.

                        A -> R2 -> R1 -> C1 -> C2
                        A -> R2 -> R1 -> C2 -> C1
                        A -> R1 -> C1 -> R2 -> C2
                        A -> R2 -> C2 -> R1 -> C1
                        A -> R1 -> R2 -> C1 -> C2
                        A -> R1 -> R2 -> C2 -> C1

                        A implies for Aman
                        R1 implies for Restaurant-1
                        R2 implies for Restaurant-2
                        C1 implies for Customer-1
                        C2 implies for Customee-2

2. Assuming I will be getting latitudes and longitudes for each respective point.

3. Normal travel speed will be 20 km/hr.
